# 🌍 The Purpose of GreenLedger

**"To build the world's most trusted, transparent, and rewarding food supply chain."**

## 1. The Problem: "The Invisible Journey"
*   **Consumers** don't know where their food comes from (Unsafe).
*   **Farmers** don't get fair payment because middlemen take the profit.
*   **Brands** suffer from fake/counterfeit products.

## 2. The Solution: "Trust Protocol"
GreenLedger uses **Blockchain** to record every step of the food's journey. Because it is on the blockchain, no one can change the history. It is "Immutable Truth".

*   **Farm**: Records harvest data (Location, Quantity).
*   **Inspector**: Verifies quality (AI & Manual).
*   **Store**: Scans to prove it is authentic.

## 3. The Key Features
*   **Transparency**: Customers scan a QR code to see the *entire* history.
*   **Incentives (GreenTokens)**: We don't just track; we *reward*. Farmers earn crypto-tokens for sustainable practices.
*   **Efficiency (AI)**: We use AI to speed up quality checks, removing human error.

## 🎯 The One-Line Pitch
*"GreenLedger isn't just a tracking app; it's a financial ecosystem that rewards farmers for being honest and transparent."*
