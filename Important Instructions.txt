IMPORTANT: The project has been modernized to use Webpack.

1. Start Ganache (Port 8545).
2. Run `npm install` (if not done).
3. Run `truffle migrate --reset`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.

Do NOT manually copy contract addresses. The system now handles this automatically using the build artifacts.
Use `npm run build` to rebuild the project artifacts if needed.
